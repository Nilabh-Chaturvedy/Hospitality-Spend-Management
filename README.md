This project was done as a part of my Industrial Practicum. 
25 Students were selected to partner with Kearney Consulting Firm to solve critical business problems their clients have been facing. 
I along with four other members, worked with one of the largest hospitality procurement firm to train advanced Machine Learning Models 
to predict annual spend of their client properties(more than 10k spanning across Hyat, Marriot, Holiday Inn etc.).
